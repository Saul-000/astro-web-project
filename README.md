# 🚀 Java Web Application with AWS CI/CD

A scalable Java-based web application demonstrating end-to-end DevOps best practices using AWS services and CI/CD automation. Built with reliability, maintainability, and modern cloud tooling in mind.

---

## 📌 Introduction

This project showcases a Java web application integrated with a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS tools such as CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and EC2. It's designed to demonstrate how software can be continuously built, tested, and deployed to the cloud in an automated and secure manner.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Backend & Build
- Java 17
- Spring Boot (or Jakarta EE / custom servlet framework)
- Apache Maven or Gradle

### CI/CD and Infrastructure
- AWS CodePipeline
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodeDeploy
- Amazon EC2 (Linux)
- Amazon S3 (for artifacts)
- GitHub (source control & webhook trigger)

### Deployment & Monitoring
- Apache or Nginx (optional)
- Amazon CloudWatch (logs/monitoring)
- IAM Roles & Policies for secure access

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Build Locally
./mvnw clean install
# or if using Gradle
./gradlew build

3. AWS CI/CD Setup
Ensure the following are configured in your AWS account:

S3 bucket for build artifacts

EC2 instance with IAM role for CodeDeploy

CodePipeline with GitHub source and CodeBuild stage

appspec.yml and buildspec.yml files are included in root directory

4. Deploy
On pushing to the main/master branch, CodePipeline automatically:

Pulls from GitHub

Builds using CodeBuild

Deploys to EC2 via CodeDeploy
